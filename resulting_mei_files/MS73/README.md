## MEI file encoding the music and text of MS73 (CDN-Mlr_MS73)

These files were obtained through the end-to-end OMR workfow in Rodan.

The folios of this manuscript have been numbered in two different ways. The numbering on Cantus Database follows the usual convention of numbering by folio. The images, however, are numbered by page (don't ask us why). The naming convention for these files includes both numbering systems, to avoid all confusion: `<siglum>_<folio number>-<page number>`. Example for folio 1r of [MS73](https://cantusdatabase.org/source/680970): `CDN-Mlr_MS73_001r-004`.

There are three sets of files:

- The files as obtained by the OMR workflow, before being corrected by a user in Neon. These are found in the folder `Ready for Neon`.
- The files as obtained by the OMR workflow and corrected by a user in Neon. These are found in the folder `Processed`.
- The same files double-checked by an expert (also using the Neon editor). These are found in the folder `Reviewed`.
