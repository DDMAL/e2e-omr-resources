## MEI Files Encoding the Music and Text of the Einsiedeln manuscript (CH-E 611)

These MEI files were obtained through the end-to-end OMR workflow in Rodan.

The naming convention of these files is: `<siglum>_<folio number>`. Example for folio 1r in the Einsiedeln manuscript: `CH-E_611_001r`

There are three sets of files:
  
- The files as obtained by the OMR workflow, before being corrected by a user in Neon. These are found the folder `ready_for_neon`.
- The files corrected by a user in Neon. These are found in the folder `Processed`.
- The same files double-checked by an expert (also using the Neon editor). These are found in the folder `Reviewed_once`.

A (fairly) complete record of the OMR and correction of this manuscript can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmNAhP2MoIwyNP6EgA-YJr6xC03_V895tokWRCTMMu0/edit#gid=0
